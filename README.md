# Bar Chart Creator
A simple program for creating bar charts. The user enters labels and values for the bars, and the program displays the chart. It also allows the user to fix mistakes by removing the last bar. Admittedly, the user interface is a bit limited.

 Program needs the following user-interface components:

- A text field for entering a bar label 
- A text field for entering a bar value
- A button for adding a new bar with the given label and value
- A button for removing the last bar 
- A component for drawing the chart
